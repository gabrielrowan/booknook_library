# What does borrowing look like?

When a book has successfully been renewed:

Booknook comes with built-in library validation rules (what's a library without a few rules? :smiley:) such as only being able to renw books for up to 90 days after its initial borrow date.

## What's coming up in the next release?

- Adding the ability to filter books by subgenre on the homepage (ie. if you're only interested in books about 'Hobbits', you would click the 'Hobbits' subgrene button to only see 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit')

## What's on the roadmap?

- Giving users the ability to **add comments** and **rate** books
- Giving each book a rating based on user ratings
- Adding a page for a user to record books they want to read, books they are reading and books they have read
