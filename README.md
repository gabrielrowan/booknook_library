## What does borrowing look like?

When a book has successfully been renewed:

Booknook comes with built-in library validation rules (what's a library without a few rules? :smiley:) such as only being able to renw books for up to 90 days after its initial borrow date.

## Aesthetic Book & Author Pages

Booknook provides aesthetic web pages where users can:
- See what number the book is in a series (for example, Cursebound is the 2nd book of The Faebound Trilogy)
- View a book's genre and any associated subgenres
- Read the book's blurb
- View its publication data and number of pages
- Virtually borrow the book!

## What was in the latest release? :rocket:

- Booknook now comes with the option to filter the book list by subgenre, so if you only want to borrow books relating to Hobbits/ Witches/ Space or Mythology, you can do!

## What's next on the roadmap?

- Giving users the ability to **add comments** and **rate** books
- Giving each book a rating based on user ratings
- Adding a page for a user to record books they want to read, books they are reading and books they have read
