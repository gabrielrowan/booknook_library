The writing style is unique and entertaining, but it's a bit of a stretch at times. The character of Zaphod Beeblebrox is memorable, but the rest of the cast feels a bit one-dimensional.

Monica Reyes,monica_r,monica.r@swordquill.com,Circe,"Circe is a thing of dark magic, weaving a tale that's as much about the power of storytelling as it is about the witch herself. Miller's prose is a spellbinding blend of myth and mortality, with Circe's sass and wit making her a character you'll love to hate.
